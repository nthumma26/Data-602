**Prediction of Flight Dealys using various models and discussing its performances**

**Business Objective**: To build a model that enables a passenger to predict whether his flight will be delayed, and apply various models to increase the performance of the model.

**Results**:
In Logistic Regression, The ROC AUC score for the model is 67%. That means our model is able to predict 66% of the instances correctly when developed the model with various regularization strengths.

In Decision Tree, The score is 63%, which is less than that of the logistic regression.

In SVM, The accuracy scores are around 64%.

In Ensemble Learning, the The ROC AUC score is 64%.

In Adaptive Boosting mode, The ROC AUC scores for thsi model is 69%, which is higher than all the models discussed above.

Adaptive Boosting model has improved the score comparatively but it didn't impact significantly.
