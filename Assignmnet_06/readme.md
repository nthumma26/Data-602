**Diabetes Classification using Logistic Regression and it's evaluation metrics**

**Objectives**: To develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes using the input features and calculate its performance by 'recall' metric. To analyze the model using liblinear & lbfgs solvers at various regularization strengths with grid cross-validation of 10 folds.
